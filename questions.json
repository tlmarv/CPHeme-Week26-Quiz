        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "Empirical therapy in febrile neutropenic patients should include a broad-spectrum, anti-pseudomonal β-lactam such as piperacillin-tazobactam or cefepime."

        "question": "A 58-year-old man with neutropenia develops fever and a productive cough. Blood cultures are negative, but chest imaging reveals bilateral nodular infiltrates with a halo sign. What is the most likely pathogen?",

        "question": "A 42-year-old man with febrile neutropenia remains febrile after 5 days of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Abdominal imaging shows no abnormalities. Which next step is most appropriate?",
        "choices": [
            "Add antifungal therapy such as voriconazole",
            "Discontinue antibiotics and monitor",
            "Perform a bronchoscopy with BAL for Aspergillus testing",
