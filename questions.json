    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "Activation of primed neutrophils within the recipient's pulmonary capillaries is thought to be the pathomechanism of transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI). Activation occurs after exposure to soluble factors (anti-leukocyte antibodies or lipids) in the donor blood. The result is diffuse damage of pulmonary endothelial cells, which leads to leakage of interstitial fluid into the alveoli, causing an ARDS-like reaction with respiratory distress, fever, hypoxemia, and diffuse infiltrates on chest x-ray, as seen in this patient."

    "explanation": "Smudge cells in a blood smear are characteristic diagnostic markers for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Detection of B-CLL immunophenotype (CD5, CD19, CD20, CD23) in flow cytometry would further support the diagnosis. CLL is a low-grade malignancy, noted for its slow rate of cell division and disease progression. In asymptomatic patients, treatment is often unnecessary as it is unlikely to improve survival time."

    "question": "A 53-year-old woman comes to the physician because of increasing shortness of breath on exertion for 5 months. She reports that she can no longer climb more than 2 flights of stairs or run her errands as usual. One year ago, she was diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer and underwent a right-sided modified radical mastectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy. Cardiac examination shows a laterally displaced point of maximal impulse. Coarse inspiratory crackles are heard in both lower lung fields. Echocardiography shows a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30%. The physician informs the patient that her symptoms are most likely due to an adverse effect of her chemotherapy. The drug most likely responsible for the patient's current symptoms belongs to which of the following groups of agents?",
    "choices": [
        "Monoclonal antibodies",
        "Alkylating agents",
        "Vinca alkaloids",
        "Antimetabolites",
        "Topoisomerase I inhibitors",

    "explanation": "Anthracyclines (e.g., doxorubicin) are associated with an increased risk of developing dilated cardiomyopathy with left heart failure, as seen in this patient. Adjuvant chemotherapy with anthracyclines is often used in patients with triple-negative breast cancer because these tumors are aggressive and do not respond to hormonal or targeted therapies. Concomitant use of the iron-chelating agent dexrazoxane can help prevent anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity."

    "question": "A 71-year-old man with colorectal cancer comes to the physician for follow-up examination after undergoing a sigmoid colectomy. The physician recommends adjuvant chemotherapy with an agent that results in single-stranded DNA breaks. This chemotherapeutic agent most likely has an effect on which of the following enzymes?",
    "choices": [
        "Telomerase",
        "Topoisomerase II",

        "DNA polymerase III",
        "Topoisomerase I"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 5,
    "explanation": "Topoisomerase I is an enzyme that cuts one of the two strands of double-stranded DNA to remove supercoils during DNA replication. Its inhibition (e.g., by irinotecan or topotecan) prevents proper unwinding of supercoils and reannealing of DNA during DNA replication. This inhibition causes single-stranded DNA breaks, which accumulate and prevent proper DNA replication, transcription, and DNA repair, inducing cell cycle arrest in the late S phase or early G2 phase."

His only medications are a daily multivitamin and ibuprofen, which he takes daily for the back pain. Physical examination shows tenderness to palpation over the lower spine and the left iliac crest. His hemoglobin concentration is 9.3 g/dL, his serum calcium concentration is 12 mg/dL, and his serum creatinine concentration is 2.1 mg/dL. A bone marrow biopsy shows 21% plasma cells. A diagnosis of multiple myeloma is established. In preparation for an autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, the patient receives a myeloablative treatment regimen that includes busulfan. Which of the following drugs acts via a similar mechanism of action to busulfan?",
    "choices": [
        "Vemurafenib",
        "Bleomycin",
        "Etoposide",
        "Lomustine",
        "Vincristine",
        "Cytarabine"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "Lomustine is an alkylating chemotherapeutic agent of the nitrosourea subgroup; similar to busulfan, it inhibits DNA replication by creating cross-links between DNA strands. These modifications cannot be repaired, which results in cell apoptosis. Busulfan is used as part of a conditioning regimen prior to autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, as seen in this patient. Important adverse effects include myelosuppression, pulmonary fibrosis, and cutaneous hyperpigmentation. Lomustine is used to treat brain tumors and Hodgkin lymphoma. Important adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, and central nervous system dysfunction (e.g., ataxia, lethargy)."

    "correctAnswer": 5,
    "explanation": "Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most frequent malignant disease in children and has a peak incidence between the ages of 2 and 5 years. ALL may manifest with bone pain, fatigue, fever, hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia (with bleeding diathesis), and leukocytosis. Most forms of ALL arise from B cell precursors and therefore show CD19+ and CD10+ immunophenotype as well as cells that are positive for TdT on a bone marrow examination."

        "Myeloperoxidase",
        "Tartrate resistant acid phosphatase",
        "Periodic acid-Schiff",
        "Cluster of differentiation 1a",
        "Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "The presence of myeloperoxidase (MPO) in leukemic cells of a bone marrow aspirate confirms that the cells are of myeloid lineage, and thus differentiates acute myeloid leukemia (AML) from MPO-negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). This patient's age, clinical presentation, lab values, and t(15;17) translocation indicate AML, which is why the cells of his bone marrow aspirate will likely stain positive for MPO. Another characteristic feature of AML is Auer rods, which are particularly associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia. Acute promyelocytic leukemia can be treated with vitamin A derivatives such as ATRA (all-trans-retinoic acid)."

    "correctAnswer": 5,
    "explanation": "This patient most likely has a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), which is the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in adults, accounting for approximately 25% of cases. DLBCL is an aggressive (high-grade) type of lymphoma occurring spontaneously or secondary to various types of low-grade B-cell lymphomas (e.g., chronic lymphocytic leukemia or MALT lymphoma). Patients with high-grade B-cell NHL are first treated with curative intent, typically with polychemotherapy such as R-CHOP (a combination of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) and the CD20 antibody rituximab."

    "question": "A 54-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She had a mastectomy 6 months ago and received chemotherapy with doxorubicin and paclitaxel. A CT scan of the chest shows new metastases in the lungs and liver. Adjuvant therapy is initiated with a drug that inhibits the formation of deoxythymidine monophosphate and results in the accumulation of deoxyuridine triphosphate. The patient is advised to avoid folic acid supplementation while receiving this drug in order to prevent the toxic effects of this drug. Which of the following drugs was most likely given?",
    "choices": [
        "Hydroxyurea",
        "Azathioprine",
        "Mycophenolate mofetil",
        "Methotrexate",
        "Capecitabine"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 4,
    "explanation": "Capecitabine is converted to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in vivo. 5-FU covalently binds to and inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthase, subsequently preventing the formation of deoxythymidine monophosphate, an essential component of DNA, and increasing the concentration of its precursors, deoxyuridine monophosphate and deoxyuridine triphosphate. 5-FU can bind to thymidylate synthase only in the presence of methylene-tetrahydrofolate, which is a derivative of folic acid and a cofactor of thymidylate synthase. Therefore, the administration of folic acid concurrently with 5-FU or capecitabine augments the effects of these drugs by increasing their binding to thymidylate synthase and simultaneously increases the risk of adverse effects (e.g., myelotoxicity). In contrast, the therapeutic efficacy and the toxic effects of methotrexate are decreased by concurrent folic acid supplementation."

Further positive prognostic factors include a leukocyte count < 50,000/mm³, no central nervous system involvement, and hyperploidy. Factors associated with a poor prognosis include a Philadelphia translocation t(9;22) and age < 1 year or > 10 years. Approximately 85% of children with ALL achieve complete remission with chemotherapy."
